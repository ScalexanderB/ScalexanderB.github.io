## Scott Bradley Portfolio

# What it's about:

* This is a personal portfolio created to showcase my current and future projects.
* It includes a little information about myself, how to contact me and what I've done.

# Application Url:

* https://scalexanderb.github.io/

# Steps I took:

* First I had created a rough wireframe for me to work off of
* Built the starting HTML structure
* Styled each section one by one to create the desired look
* Adjusted the code as needed for styling
* Added media queries to make it look good on multiple screen sizes
* Added final touches before submitting
